# reveal.js

A framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML. [Check out the live demo](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).

**Note**: _This version is themed & modified for usage within General Assembly,
based on the GA fonts and styles._

reveal.js comes with a broad range of features including [nested slides](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markup), [Markdown contents](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown), [PDF export](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export), [speaker notes](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#speaker-notes) and a [JavaScript API](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#api). It's best viewed in a modern browser but [fallbacks](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Browser-Support) are available to make sure your presentation can still be viewed elsewhere.

## Instructions

Check out the example in `index.html` for how to structure slides.

See [the reveal.js docs](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) for a complete
list of instructions.

### Markdown

It's possible to write your slides using Markdown. Markdown support has been
added to the example slides in `index.html`

reveal.js supports [GitHub Flavored
Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown). Sensitive
to indentation (avoid mixing tabs and spaces) and line breaks (avoid consecutive
breaks).

```html
<section data-markdown>
	<script type="text/template">
		## Page title

		A paragraph with some text and a [link](http://hakim.se).
	</script>
</section>
```

#### Element Attributes

Special syntax (in html comment) is available for adding attributes to Markdown elements. This is useful for fragments, amongst other things.

```html
<section data-markdown>
	<script type="text/template">
    - Item 1 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Item 2 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	</script>
</section>
```

(See below for a description on _Fragments_)

#### Slide Attributes

Special syntax (in html comment) is available for adding attributes to the slide `<section>` elements generated by your Markdown.

```html
<section data-markdown>
	<script type="text/template">
	<!-- .slide: data-background="#ff0000" -->
		Markdown content
	</script>
</section>
```


### Presentation Size

By default, the General Assembly theme is fully responsive and should display
nicely on any display size. It is good practice to test it out on a couple of
different resolutions (by resizing the window) to ensure things will work
correctly when connect to an external display or projector.

### Fragments

Fragments are used to highlight individual elements on a slide. Every element with the class ```fragment``` will be stepped through before moving on to the next slide. Here's an example: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/fragments

The default fragment style is to start out invisible and fade in. This style can be changed by appending a different class to the fragment:

### Code syntax highlighting

By default, Reveal is configured with [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for code syntax highlighting. Below is an example with clojure code that will be syntax highlighted. When the `data-trim` attribute is present, surrounding whitespace is automatically removed.  HTML will be escaped by default. To avoid this, for example if you are using `<mark>` to call out a line of code, add the `data-noescape` attribute to the `<code>` element.

```html
<section>
	<pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
(def lazy-fib
  (concat
   [0 1]
   <mark>((fn rfib [a b]</mark>
        (lazy-cons (+ a b) (rfib b (+ a b)))) 0 1)))
	</code></pre>
</section>
```

### Fullscreen mode
Press »F« on your keyboard to show your presentation in fullscreen mode. Press the »ESC« key to exit fullscreen mode.

### Speaker Notes

reveal.js comes with a speaker notes plugin which can be used to present per-slide notes in a separate browser window. The notes window also gives you a preview of the next upcoming slide so it may be helpful even if you haven't written any notes. Press the 's' key on your keyboard to open the notes window.

Notes are defined by using a special delimiter: `Note:`, after which all lines
are considered a note until the next slide begins:

```
# Title
## Sub-title

Here is some content...

Note:
This will only display in the notes window.
```

### Setup

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

2. Copy this presentation directory

3. Navigate to the copied directory

4. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   $ npm install
   ```

5. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes
   ```sh
   $ grunt serve
   ```

6. Open <http://localhost:8000> to view your presentation

   You can change the port by using `grunt serve --port 8001`.
